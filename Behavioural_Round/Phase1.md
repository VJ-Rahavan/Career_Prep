1. Self Intro
   Hello! My name is Vijayarahavan, and I am a passionate software developer specializing in frontend development with over 2.5 years of experience. I hold a bachelor's degree from VHNSN College and am currently pursuing my master's at SRM University.

   I am currently working as a Technology Engineer at PurpleSlate, where I have gained hands-on experience in designing and building responsive, user-friendly websites and mobile applications. I have worked in technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and React Native, along with tools like Git, GitHub, and VS Code. I have led teams through the complete mobile development lifecycle, from the design phase to deployment, and I also have expertise in deploying apps to both the Play Console and the App Store.

2. Can you share your biggest professional achievement so far?
   While I was working on our AI bot, we received a request from one of our stakeholders to implement a speech-to-text feature. The task involved developing a live speech-to-text functionality using the Azure Speech SDK. I explored a couple of third-party libraries to process the input audio stream. By combining React Native's live audio input stream capabilities with the Azure Speech SDK, I successfully achieved the required functionality. As a result, I was appreciated by my team lead, and the entire team received recognition from the stakeholder.

3. Can you describe a challenging project you worked on and how you handled it?
   In my current company, while working on the FAQ chatbot application, we had a settings screen that needed to be responsive for both tablet and mobile views. Along with this, we were tasked with replicating the exact sliding drawer animation from the iOS settings application for the tablet view. I took the lead on this project, learned how to implement sliding drawer animations using Reanimated for the tablet view, and successfully applied what I had learned. Additionally, I guided my team through the entire task. The final output turned out to be excellent and received a lot of positive attention.

4. How does your experience align with the requirements of this role?
   My experience aligns well with this role, particularly in React Native, TypeScript, and state management libraries like Redux. I have experience writing clean, maintainable code with TypeScript and managing complex application states using Redux. I’m confident my skills and problem-solving ability make me a strong fit for this position.

5. When faced with multiple tasks, how do you prioritize your work?
   While working on a complex project, we faced a heavy workload with multiple competing priorities. My responsibility was to ensure tasks were completed on time while keeping the team aligned and maintaining quality. I evaluated each task based on its urgency and impact, identified the critical items, and prioritized them accordingly. I also ensure regular updates and check-ins with the team to make sure we’re aligned on priorities. As a result, we successfully met all deadlines, and delivered a high-quality outcome that met stakeholder expectations.

6. Why do you want to work for our company?
   This role is a perfect fit for my skills in React Native and front-end development, and I’m eager to contribute by building user-friendly, high-quality applications. Additionally, I’m inspired by the opportunity to grow within a company that values innovation and excellence. I’m confident that working here will allow me to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact.

7. Why do you want to switch from your company?
   I’ve learned a lot at my current company and had some great experiences working with React Native, but I feel like I’ve hit a point where I need new challenges. I’m looking for an environment where I can grow further. I’m eager to contribute my skills to develop apps that can help people manage their finances more efficiently. Plus, I see this role as a great opportunity to learn new things and expand my skill set.

8. What is your strength?
   One of my key strengths is my determination and never-give-up attitude. When faced with challenges, especially in complex projects, I always push through until I find a solution. I believe in tackling problems head-on, whether it's overcoming technical roadblocks or navigating tight deadlines. I’ve learned over the years that setbacks are just opportunities to find better ways to solve problems. This mindset has helped me lead teams successfully through tough phases and deliver results, even when things seemed difficult at the start.

   (or)
   One of my key strengths is my adaptability. The tech industry evolves rapidly, and I take great pride in my ability to stay ahead by continually learning new tools and techniques. Whether it's staying up-to-date with React Native updates or adapting to new development methodologies, I thrive in dynamic environments. This agility has allowed me to guide teams through changes in direction, ensuring smooth transitions and the successful adoption of new technologies or approaches. I believe that staying adaptable is key to overcoming challenges and delivering innovative solutions in a fast-paced industry.

9. What are your goals ?
   In the short term, I really want to deepen my knowledge of Mobile Development and take on more complex, impactful projects. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems in mobile development, and I want to be part of a team where I can contribute to building apps that make a real difference. Long-term, I see myself growing into a role where I can help lead and mentor others. I enjoy collaborating with others to solve problems, and eventually, I’d like to be in a position where I can help shape the direction of projects.
